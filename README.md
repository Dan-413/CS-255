CS-255 Projects

**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**

DriverPass is a company that wants to address the issue of drivers failing their driving tests. DriverPass wants to provide students with access to online practice exams and on-the-road training to better prepare them for driving tests.

**What did you do particularly well?**

Identifying business requirements and explaining them to the client in non-technical terms. I received positive feedback on my analysis of business requirements both functional and non-functional as well as my summaries and explanations.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

I would choose to revise my UML diagrams and improve on my designs.  I may have been able to choose more interesting activity or use case diagrams which would improve presentations.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

Based on the provided interview transcript with DriverPass representatives I was able to collect requirements from the client including what the system should do, the different users of the system and what functions each user should have available.

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**

In order to start developing a program or software, I need to have a clear picture of what features it must include and what should be avoided. There must be a process of unambiguous requirement gathering before any kind of software development process begins. After getting the requirements from the client the developer should decide which software development model is best suited for the project. These models include iterative, waterfall, prototype or agile model and others. I enjoy the interview and requirements gathering portion of planning, and I think I now have a clearer picture of how useful it can be to research similar systems and their functionality.
